# Concussion Test

The project will be an application that is to be taken as a test of whether a person has a brain injury (head trauma or concussion) and how severe it is. The application will have 3 tests for the user to take, the first test will be a test of memory where a series of different images will be displayed on screen to the user and they will have to click a button when they see an image more than once. The second test will be a short-term memory test where there will be a grid of buttons and a sequence will flash and the user will have to click the buttons in the order that the sequence displayed. The third test will be test the functionality of the user’s eyes. It will consist of playing cards that will shuffle and move around on the screen and stop at a location and the user will have to choose which card is theirs, which will prove the user’s ability to follow the movement of an object with their eyes. After all tests are complete the user’s results will be displayed on screen as well as saved to a text file that they can reference later to view or share their scores.
