# Concussion Test

The project will be an application that will keep track of a person’s concussion test scores. The application will keep track of scores for 3 types of tests. The first test will be a test of memory where a series of different images will be displayed on screen to the user and they will have to click a button when they see an image more than once. The second test will be a short-term memory test where there will be a grid of buttons and a sequence will flash and the user will have to click the buttons in the order that the sequence displayed. The third test will be test the functionality of the user’s eyes. It will consist of playing cards that will shuffle and move around on the screen and stop at a location and the user will have to choose which card is theirs, which will prove the user’s ability to follow the movement of an object with their eyes. The user will be able to enter scores for each test, as well as the number of rounds for each (default is 1) and will be able to save these scores to a text file to be referenced later if desired. Also, the user will be able to load a concussion dataset from a text file and perform pre-defined aggregations on the data.
